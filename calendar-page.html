                    4:00 - 5:00PM PDT.  According to GLSEN research, transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming students face more hostile school climates than other
                     members of the LGBTQ community. In this training, we will share statistics on national data around LGBTQ student experiences, paying specific attention
                      to the experiences of trans* students. Educators will leave with a better understanding of LGBTQ and transgender student experiences, along with resources such as the Trans model policy. 
                      They will be given guidance and best practices on supporting transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming students of all age groups.
