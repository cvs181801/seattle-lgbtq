# seattle-lgbtq
This is a project my team worked together to build for Tech Together Seattle Virtual Hackathon in December 2021.  We chose to do this project in honor of December 3rd International Day of Persons with Disabilities, where we focus on the intersections of the LGBTQ+ community, the differently-abled community, and many more.
